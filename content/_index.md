Hi, I am **Punit Lodha**, a computer engineering student from Mumbai. I have worked as a frontend developer and an UI/UX designer. Recently I have been experimenting with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and was selected as a GSoC student with [CCExtractor](https://ccextractor.org/) for a [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5980303367077888) in rust. I have also been exploring [distributed systems](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/), compilers. In my free time you'll find me reading books, watching TV shows and ricing my linux desktop :)
